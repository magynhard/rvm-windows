%PATH% is a mix of USER and SYSTEM path.

So if we add a path by SETX PATH %NEW_PATH%;%PATH%,
we add all SYSTEM PATHs to USER PATH as well - and as PATH is limited to 1024 characters, it can be cut as well.

That leads to corrupting PATH. The batch files in this directory get the USER PATH by registry, to use SETX without beeing destructive.

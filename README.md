> Unofficial port of RVM.io (RVM) for MS Windows

As there is no RVM.io available for native windows, but only for POSIX by Cygwin, this is a reimplementation of rvm.io features for native MS Windows.

> Pre alpha project template.
> 
> Our goal is not to 100% reimplement all features of rvm.io, but the most important and common ones. And maybe add some special Windows related stuff.
